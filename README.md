# Linked Lists

This is an exercise in data structures dealing with implementations and applications of linked lists.

Our linked list has methods for...
- size
- search
- display forwards and backwards
- delete
- add two concatenated linked lists forwards and backwards

The exercise comes from [here](https://medium.com/@kojinoshiba/data-structures-in-python-series-1-linked-lists-d9f848537b4d).
